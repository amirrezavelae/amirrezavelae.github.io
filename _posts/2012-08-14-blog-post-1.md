# "Shāh māt" means "the king is dead" in Persian, and it’s the term used in chess when a player checkmates their opponent.

[Take Take Take][https://taketaketake.com/] is an innovative platform dedicated to tracking chess tournaments and providing live updates on ongoing games. Recently, the site hosted an exciting contest to identify the best AI chess player, with Kaggle facilitating the competition. The challenge? To build an AI capable of playing chess at a grandmaster level.

As both an AI enthusiast and a chess fan, I’ve long been curious about why large language models (LLMs) struggle with chess, especially when compared to other specialized AIs. (For a deeper dive into this, check out this fascinating video from [GothamChess][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWhlrkfJrCQ&ab_channel=GothamChess].) So this contest was a perfect opportunity to explore this question further.

# Chess: A Game of Strategy and Phases

In chess, the game is divided into three main phases: **opening**, **middlegame**, and **endgame**.

### **Opening**

The **opening** refers to the first few moves where players focus on developing pieces, controlling the center, and ensuring the king's safety. Common strategies include moves like the **Sicilian Defense** or **Ruy Lopez**.

### **Middlegame**

The **middlegame** begins once the pieces are developed. This phase is all about tactical battles, with players trying to create weaknesses, attack the opponent's king, or gain material advantage. It’s where most of the action happens.

### **Endgame**

The **endgame** comes when there are fewer pieces left, and players focus on promoting pawns and checkmating the opponent. Precision is key, and mastering endgame techniques can turn a slight advantage into victory.
