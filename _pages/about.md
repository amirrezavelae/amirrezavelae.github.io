  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hey there! I'm Amirreza Velae ‚Äî an Electrical Engineering and Mathematics student at Sharif University of Technology. I'm deeply curious about how intelligent systems learn and improve, which naturally led me to the world of machine learning, optimization, and especially reinforcement learning.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Last summer, I had the opportunity to have remote research experience at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems with 
    <a href="https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/graphics-vision/people/charusaie/" target="_blank">Amin Charusaie</a>, where I worked on a project related to adding human feedback to Neural Networks with bayesian layers.
    Right now, I‚Äôm working on my B.Sc. thesis under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=dcjIFccAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Hamed Shah-Mansouri</a>, where I'm exploring the convergence of the ADAM optimizer in policy gradient methods. I‚Äôm also fascinated by RL theory and bandit algorithms ‚Äî anything that helps us better understand learning and decision-making.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of academics, you‚Äôll usually find me playing chess or soccer, reading a good book, or watching movies. I'm always up for movie or music recommendations ‚Äî so if you‚Äôve got a favorite film or playlist, send it my way!
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to reach out through the contact info or social links on the left. Whether you want to chat about research, share a cool idea, or just say hi ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear from you!
