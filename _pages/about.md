Hi, This is Amirreza. I am a 3rd-year BSc student in Electrical Engineering at Sharif University of Technology with a minor in Applied Mathematics. You can have a look at my [CV](https://amirrezavelae.github.io//cv/) for more information about my background and experiences.
 I am interested in Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Robotics.  Currently, I am working on a project on Diffusion Models, aiming to solve stochastic differential equations faster and more robustly in inference under the supervision of [Dr. Mohammadhossein Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am also a part of [Resana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/resana-association-482575168/) association as an associate consultant. In Resana, we are holding various workshops and events to help students to find their interests and improve their skills.
